<h2><img align="center" height="64" src="icon_128x128.png"/> Open Bookmark Manager </h2>

![Demo](set-bookmark-folder.png)

A simple [google chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions) that adds a button <img height="14" src="icon_128x128.png" /> 
to your extensions bar which will open up your Bookmark Manager in a new tab on a single click. You may specify a 
"favourite" bookmark folder which will be loaded when the icon is clicked.


### Credits 

Thanks to unknown authors of this extension. It had disappeared from google web store so I have saved it. Currently only `manifest v2` is published. I may update it in the future. I didn't make a `.crx` archive due to lack of time on hands.
