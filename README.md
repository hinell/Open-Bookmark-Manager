<h2><img align="center" height="64" src="icon_128x128.png"/> Open Bookmark Manager </h2>

![Demo](set-bookmark-folder.png)

A simple [google chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions) that adds a button <img height="14" src="icon_128x128.png" /> 
to your extensions bar which will open up your Bookmark Manager in a new tab on a single click. You may specify a 
"favourite" bookmark folder which will be loaded when the icon is clicked.


### Credits 

Thanks to unknown authors of this extension. It had disappeared from google web store so I have saved it. Currently both Google Extension Manifest `v2` and `v3` are supported.  
If you need `v2` for older browsers, download a `.zip` file of the `v1.3` version. 


### Download & Install

1. Head over to **Tags** page
2. Find an appropriate release tag (.e.g `v1.4`)
3. Download `.zip` and unpack the archive
4. Head over to chrome window, open extensions manager
5. Toggle developer mode, then, **load unpacked** 
6. Specify path to the unpacked archive from step 3
